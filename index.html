        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2><b>Personal</b></h2>
        <p> 
        Outside of school, I enjoy almost anything I do with my friends. Usually that means I am <i>eating, hiking, and playing video games a lot.</i>
        <br>
        I also am intensely interested in investing (I often learn about new company prospects and read quarterly reports) and usually love spending time with family.

            <p>
                As a programmer, I am relatively inexperienced outside of regular coursework.
                <br>
                However, I am currently trying to get more involved by taking  , a React + NodeJS + MongoDB course which was suggested to me by a friend.

                You can see my progress in my github repo: FullStackOpen.
